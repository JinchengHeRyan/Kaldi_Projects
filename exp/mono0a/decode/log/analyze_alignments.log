Overall, eh accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.5,10) frames.
Overall, ao accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.9,28) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 30.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 71.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 2.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,16.7,42)
