Overall, ey accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.4,28) frames.
Overall, uw accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,19.3,34) frames.
Overall, w accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.1,28) frames.

Overall, eh accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.6,15) frames.
Overall, ao accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.8,26) frames.
Overall, th accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.5,18) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 32.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 2.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,15.3,39)
