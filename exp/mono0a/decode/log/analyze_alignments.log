At utterance begin, sil accounts for 99.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,25.6,49) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 99.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.8,27) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 0.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,27.8,43) frames.
At utterance end, ow accounts for 0.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,27.8,43) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 85.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,9.8,25) frames.
Overall, ow accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,7.9,21) frames.
Overall, r accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.5,32) frames.
Overall, iy accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,7.6,17) frames.
Overall, z accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,7.4,15) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 14.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,22.7,45) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 3.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,15.5,38)
