Overall, ey accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.9,28) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 32.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 2.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,15.6,39)
