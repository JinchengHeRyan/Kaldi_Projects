At utterance begin, sil accounts for 99.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,25.1,49) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 99.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.2,25) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 1.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.9,42) frames.
At utterance end, ow accounts for 1.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.9,42) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 85.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,9.7,24) frames.
Overall, iy accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,7.7,18) frames.
Overall, z accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,7.3,15) frames.
Overall, ow accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,8.3,21) frames.
Overall, r accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,15.3,30) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 14.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,21.8,45) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 74.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 3.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,12.3,35)
