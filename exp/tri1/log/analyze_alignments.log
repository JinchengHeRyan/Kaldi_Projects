Overall, eh accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.0,15) frames.
Overall, ey accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,18.1,27) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 2.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,12.5,35)
