At utterance begin, sil accounts for 99.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,25.2,48) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 98.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.1,26) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 1.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,28.3,44) frames.
At utterance end, ow accounts for 1.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,28.3,44) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 85.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,9.8,24) frames.
Overall, ow accounts for 21.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,8.4,21) frames.
Overall, r accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.6,31) frames.
Overall, iy accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,7.7,18) frames.
Overall, z accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.5,16) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 14.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,21.7,45) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 74.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 3.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,11.8,35)
