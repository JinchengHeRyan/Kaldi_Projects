Overall, th accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,10.9,17) frames.
Overall, eh accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.5,15) frames.
Overall, ao accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.7,25) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 2.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,11.9,35)
