Overall, th accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.3,19) frames.
Overall, eh accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,8.7,11) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 29.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 3.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,10.8,34)
